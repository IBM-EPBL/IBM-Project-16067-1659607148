# INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The main problem every inventory stock manager face is to keep a track of how
much stock is purchased and how much stock is spent out. The stock admin does
not have an easy way to manage and see stocks that is purchased and is dispatched
out in the organization.

At present this is done, where manager has to manually keep the reports in hand
and calculate the costs eventually. The organization admin also does not have any
easy way to look at the details and the amount of stock that is being purchased
and dispatched. The cost that is spent on the food items is also not known exactly
to the college admins.

Usually, Inventory Management systems are limited and fixed to a selected range
of items and cannot be modified and extended based on the customer’s needs.

The Inventory Management System focuses on making it expandable and usable
easily by the end user and with constant customer support to alter the user
interface as needed, separate login credentials are provided for the manager and
the organization to insert and manage the stock and view the same respectively.

Unlike, other software’s that provide similar kind of functionalities, Inventory
Management System focuses on making it easier by adding additional
functionalities like vendor details and allowing to take attendance and keep a
count of number of members belonging to that organization.
